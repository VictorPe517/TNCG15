# TNCG15

## A Monte-Carlo Ray Tracer made for the course 'TNCG15 : Global Illumination & Rendering'.

The course introduces the mathematical models and theory for creating a ray tracer, but the implementation is all ours.
Created in C++.

## Currently an implementation of a Monte-Carlo raytracer with support for:
+ Direct Lighting
+ Soft Shadows
+ Recursive mirror rendering
+ Anti-Aliasing
+ Translucency - Refraction and Reflection
+ Global Illumination
+ Multiple Area Light Sources
+ Colored Light Sources
+ Bounding Box AABB Collision Simplification
+ Memory usage optimized
+ Arbitrary Resolutions and Sample Counts
+ Tonemapping and Color Correction
